        <h2>Arbitrum trade volume and market listings</h2>
        <p>Arbitrum is a decentralized exchange that uses liquidity pools (LPs) to make markets instead of a typical
            order book. These pools are defined by smart contracts that facilitate the swapping of tokens and the adding
            of liquidity — there are no order books, centralized parties, or central facilitators. Arbitrum users pool
            two assets that are then traded against, with the price determined by the ratio between the two. Anyone with
            ERC-20 tokens can add liquidity to these pools by adding an equal value of each token to the LP. When
            providing liquidity to an LP, users receive a LP token that is redeemable for the underlying assets plus
            fees at any time, and fees are evenly distributed amongst the individual pool.</p>
        <h2>What Does the Future Hold for Arbitrum?</h2>
        <p>As they say, imitation is the greatest flattery. Arbitrum has no shortage of copycats, such as Arbitrum or
            Arbitrum DEX. After all, Arbitrum’s open-source code is easy to copy and slightly tweak. However, after
            initial promises of higher liquidity yields, they deflated while Arbitrum remained steadfast.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Arbitrum’s main obstacle came from Ethereum itself. The biggest smart contract platform with
            over $109B TVL is undergoing a transition itself, from proof-of-work to fully proof-of-stake consensus with
            the upcoming Beacon Chain merger. As a result, Ethereum gas fees have not been affordable, to say the least.
        </p>
